# Hexapod Robot for Terrain Navigation — Research Platform Summary

This repository provides an overview of a research-oriented hexapod robotic platform developed for terrain navigation and mobility experimentation.

The platform is designed to support studies in legged locomotion, kinematic control, and autonomous navigation in unstructured environments. Its modular mechanical architecture and configurable actuation allow investigation of multiple gait strategies and control approaches.

## Platform Overview

The robot features a polycarbonate structural frame fabricated using FDM 3D printing, supporting both 12-servo and 18-servo configurations. Each leg is composed of coxa, femur, and tibia segments, enabling multi-degree-of-freedom motion and adaptable gait generation.

The design emphasizes robustness, modularity, and compatibility with sensing and perception modules for future autonomy research.
